## Factory partition layouts

CrossInk's language and hyphenation packs work on PSRAM-equipped devices such as
the X4 Pro even when an app-only installation keeps the smaller factory data
partition. No bootloader flash or repartitioning is required for these packs.
SD and Wi-Fi updates can continue to preserve the existing firmware slots.

On these devices CrossInk automatically keeps its prepared pack cache at
`/.crosspoint/asset-cache.bin` on the SD card and loads the active data into PSRAM
at boot. Keep this cache on the SD card; see [Languages](languages.md) for details.
Devices with a compatible internal data partition continue to use it.

## Web Installation via USB

#### For new installs and updates.

Flashing means writing the CrossInk firmware (the reader's software) onto the device. Inky does this from your browser over a USB cable. Use a browser that supports it, such as Chrome or Edge.

1. Connect your reader to your computer with a USB-C cable.
2. Open [https://inky.crossink.dev/#flash-tools](https://inky.crossink.dev/#flash-tools) and select your device model.
3. The latest version is selected for you. To go back to an earlier build, pick it from the dropdown.
4. Choose the firmware option you want to install.
5. Click **Flash Firmware** and follow the prompts.

Keep the reader connected until Inky says it is finished. Some devices need to be put into download mode first. If Inky asks, follow the steps it shows. The X4 Pro uses the ESP32-S3 firmware option.

## USB Drive

On the X4 Classic and X4 Pro, you can plug the reader into your computer and use its SD card like a USB stick. This is handy for copying books and fonts.

1. On the reader, go to **Home > File Transfer > USB Drive**.
2. Connect the reader to your computer with a USB-C cable.
3. When you are done, eject the drive on your computer first, then unplug the cable.

The reader returns to the Home screen once the drive is ejected or the cable is removed.

## SD Card Firmware Update

#### For installing newer versions of CrossInk. Can be used by USB locked devices.

1. Follow the steps from the Web Installation method above. Inky has an option to download the firmware instead of flashing over USB.
2. Copy the downloaded `firmware-*.bin` file to your SD card. It can go in any folder.
3. On the reader, go to **Settings > System > SD Card Firmware Update**, choose the `.bin` file, and confirm the update.
4. Do not turn the reader off until the update finishes.

If your reader already runs CrossInk, **Settings > System > Check for Updates** can also check for the latest version and install it over Wi-Fi.

## USB Locked Devices

Some devices ship with USB data transfer turned off, so a computer cannot flash them. If that is yours:

1. Open [https://inky.crossink.dev/#flash-tools](https://inky.crossink.dev/#flash-tools) and tick **I have a locked device** at the top.
2. The latest version is selected for you. To go back to an earlier build, pick it from the dropdown.
3. Choose the firmware option you want to download.
4. Click **Download update.bin** and follow the instructions on the page.

## Command Line

#### Advanced. Most people should use the web installer above.

These instructions are for macOS and Linux, and for the Xteink X3 and X4 (the examples use `--chip esp32c3`). Windows users and owners of the X4 Classic, X4 Pro, or Sticky should use the web installer.

Install `esptool`:

```sh
pip3 install esptool
```

Download the `firmware-*.bin` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/uxjulia/CrossInk/releases), then connect your device with USB-C.

Find the device port:

```sh
# Linux
dmesg | grep tty

# macOS
ls /dev/cu.*
```

Flash the firmware:

```sh
# Linux
esptool.py --chip esp32c3 --port /dev/ttyACM0 --baud 921600 write_flash 0x10000 /path/to/firmware.bin

# macOS
esptool.py --chip esp32c3 --port /dev/cu.usbmodem2101 --baud 921600 write_flash 0x10000 /path/to/firmware.bin
```

Replace the port and firmware path with your actual values.
